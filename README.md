# frontend-mentor-four-card-feature-section
Solution to the Frontend Mentor Four card feature section challenge using HTML and CSS flexbox.

The layout was created purely using flexbox. The three columns were placed inside a container whose display property was set to flex, then the first and third columns were also given the display property of flex. These two columns were then given a flex-direction of column, along with being centered along the main axis.
